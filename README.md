# Tree_Climber

The following code is used to control our 5 servo robot and its respective sensors to climb a branchless tree.

These are the steps to activate the autonomous tree climbing task:

#1 open the robot grippers and place the robot on the tree carefully while closing the grippers around the trunk. The robot should be able to hold itself without power
#2 connect the robot to power and upload the algorithm to the microcontroller - if you have not done so already
#3 the robot will move to its inital position (without falling from the tree)
#4 be ready to take the robot off when it reaches the bottom tree by first pressing the reset button and then disconnecting the power
